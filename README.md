An example of what the group would work on, is advising the SEC on whether or not a certain token or instrument should be a security or not. 

Revenue Streams:

    * We accept crypto and USD donations to offset capital gains

* Financial institutions who are creating products and instruments and want to deliver value to their customers
* Developers and entrepreneurs building products and ecosystems
* Government stakeholders who want to know how to build their policies
